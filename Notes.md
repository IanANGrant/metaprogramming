# Introduction #

The code here is certain to be Moscow ML specific, so you would need [Moscow ML](http://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html) installed if you want to run it,

But ideally you won't want to run it, you will instead want to rewrite it in another language. All you need then is to understand the Standard ML as it is presented here, and for that you will find Mads Tofte's [twenty-page summary of Standard ML](http://www.itu.dk/people/tofte/publ/tips.pdf) very useful.
